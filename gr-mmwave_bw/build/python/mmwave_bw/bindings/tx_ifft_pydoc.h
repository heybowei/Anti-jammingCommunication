 static const char *__doc_gr_mmwave_bw_tx_ifft = R"doc(<+description of block+>

Constructor Specific Documentation:

Return a shared_ptr to a new instance of mmwave_bw::tx_ifft.

To avoid accidental use of raw pointers, mmwave_bw::tx_ifft's constructor is in a private implementation class. mmwave_bw::tx_ifft::make is the public interface for creating new instances.

Args:
